### About Me üë®‚Äçüíº
<p><i>Hey there, Im <b>Fyzz!</b> I've been a "tech nerd" my whole life. Starting way back as a kid building robots with legos and programming them to do differant things like opening doors, following noises, path following on colored lines and so on. From there got interested in coding and web development so I taught myself CSS HTML and JS off and on for a few years. That lead into doing little pranks with some friends in school with Batch and VBS files and I got my first taste of "hacking". From there I took a DEV break and worked in the 3d Graphics field using Blender and some other 3d Softwares and assisted in building some NFT projects as an artist and worked on Stream overlays and alerts for streamers. Took both the art and web dev skills into my first project for a fan site on another NFT project, during that project I taught myself React and Nextjs and some back end database managment. Presently I spend most my time in the cyber security field doing CTFs and bug bounties with an awesome team known as the Saints and working on tools in that area!</i>
